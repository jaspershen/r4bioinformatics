# r4bioinformatics

Welcome to the r4bioinformatics repository!

This repository serves as a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). It provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your own book.

Inside the `.Rmd` files, you will find some pointers to help you get started. However, feel free to delete the content in each file and start fresh according to your needs.

## Additional Resources
